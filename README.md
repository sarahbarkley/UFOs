# UFOs

## Overview
### Purpose of the Analysis

With this project, we aim to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll be able to filter the table for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
### Use of Website

A user looking for a particular time, place, or shape type of UFO sightings can now update one or many filters in real time on our web page.

## Summary

One drawback to this design is that it only allows for exact matches. In the future, we could make it to also filter by partial matches. I would also suggest that we add filters for all remaining data fields.
